# Rust Raytracer Project

## About the Project

This project is a personal journey into the world of Rust, coming from a C++ background. The goal is to build a raytracer from scratch, leveraging Rust's unique features and safety guarantees to explore graphics programming in a new light. This is a learning-focused project, aimed at understanding Rust's paradigms, performance characteristics, and its ecosystem.

### Project Status: Active Learning

- **Current Phase:** Initial Development
- **Start Date:** 2024-02-02
- **Expected Challenges:** Memory management, concurrency, and Rust's borrow checker.

## Learning Objectives

1. **Deep Dive into Rust:** Understanding ownership, lifetimes, and type safety.
2. **Graphics Programming:** Applying Rust to create a raytracer, understanding light and shadow rendering.
3. **Performance Optimization:** Comparing Rust's performance with C++, focusing on efficient memory usage and parallel processing.
4. **Community Engagement:** Contributing to Rust's community by sharing learnings, challenges, and solutions.

## Commitment

- **Frequency of Updates:** Aiming for 2-3 commits per week to track progress, challenges, and achievements.
- **Progress Tracking:** Each commit will highlight learning points, with occasional deep-dives into specific Rust features or raytracing techniques.
- **Open to Collaboration:** Suggestions, advice, and contributions are welcome, especially from those interested in Rust and graphics programming.

## Getting Started

For those interested in following this journey or contributing, here are some steps to get started:

1. **Prerequisites:** A basic understanding of Rust and graphics programming concepts will be helpful.
2. **Installation:** Instructions on setting up the project locally will be provided as the project develops.

## Contributing

This project is as much about learning from the community as it is about personal development. If you're interested in contributing, whether it's through code, suggestions, or resources, please feel free to reach out or submit a pull request.
